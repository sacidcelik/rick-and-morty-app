# Rick and Morty Character Index

This is a React App handling the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/). It enables the user to search for characters, view details and filter by these details. It also lets users add characters to their favorites and saves those to the local storage.

This was created as part of a group project during my neuefische web dev bootcamp.
